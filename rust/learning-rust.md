# Veriables

In Rust, variable bindings are `immutable` by default. When a variable is immutable, after a value is bound to a name, you can't change that value.

To mutate a value, we must first use the `mut` keyword to make a variable binding mutable.

```rust
// immutable variable by the Rust default rule
let immutable_variable:i64 = 23;

// Declare the mutable variable with `mut` keyword
let mut mutable_vaiable:$str= "This is the mutable variable which declared with `mut` keyword".
```
